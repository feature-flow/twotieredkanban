Trying Valuenator
=================

Valuenator demo
===============

The Valuenator demo is a version of Valuenator that stores its data
locally in your browser.  Data are stored persistently, so you can
reload the demo page or restart your browser without losing data.

The demo has all of the core features of the online version.

The demo version has some limitations:

- Because data are stored in your browser, you can't collaborate with
  other people. You also can't view data from multiple browsers.

- Searching in the demo is a little different than in the online
  version.  The demo searches for features and tasks using simple
  substring searches, while the on-line version uses a language-aware
  full-text search engine.

- It requires a modern web browser.  It is known to work with current
  versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.  Desktop browsers are
  required to drag tasks between states.

To run the demo, open the following URL:

  http://valuenator.com/demo#/board/sample

This will take you to a board with some sample features.

See the :doc:`Valuenator documentation <valuenator>` for information
of using Valuenator.

When we're ready, we'll get back to you with instructions for getting

As with the demo version, the on-line beta requires a modern browser,
such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari.

Docker image
============

There's a `Valuenator docker image
<https://github.com/feature-flow/twotieredkanban/blob/master/docker/README.rst>`_
that you can use to easily deploy Valuenator yourself using Docker.

Valuenator is open-source
=========================

Valuenator is `open source
<https://github.com/feature-flow/twotieredkanban>`_. You can check it
out from github and run it yourself, although the easiest way to run
Valuenator yourself is with the docker image.
